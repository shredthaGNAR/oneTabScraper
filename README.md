# OneTab Web-Scraper
Access here: https://sueszli.github.io/oneTabScraper/

A simple tool to scrape all your links into a list from a oneTab collection.

Alternatively this could also be done directly in your console as in this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlv7ueX4Yjc).

I initially wanted to test whether I could make a lightweight webscraper that only works with vanilla javascript in your browser but I totally forgot about CORS.
Here I'm using the CORS Anywhere reverse Proxy to bypass it - but it requires you to opt-in before usage first - so take a look at [the proxy-server repository](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) first.
